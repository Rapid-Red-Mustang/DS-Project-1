# Introduction
<span style="color: Blue;"> Our research topic aims to perform explorartory data analysis on the Nearest Earth Objects (NEO) dataset recorded by NASA. This particular dataset includes thousands of labeled observations, over the last 22 years, across multiple attributes that each aim to describe a specific object. Borrowing from the humor of the recent film *Don’t Look Up* by Adam Mckay and NASA’s success in the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, we thought that further describing and exploring this dataset would be opportune.</span> 

This EDA that we do can help with the early detection of an asteroid. With the early detection, NASA can take quick remedies to help eliminate the threat. NASA’s DART mission (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) was done for the same purpose. It was designed to deflect an asteroid with a certain momentum by hitting it head-on or attempting to slow it down. More can be read online from this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Asteroid_Redirection_Test)

According to NASA’s [official documentation](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/about/neo_groups.html) on PHAs, a PHA is technically termed using parameters that measure the asteroid’s characteristics and then make a decision if the asteroid is considered hazardous based on certain thresholds. Specifically, all asteroids with an Earth Minimum Orbit intersection Distance (MOID) of 0.05 au or less and an absolute magnitude (H) of 22.0 or less are considered Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). In other words, asteroids that can’t get any closer to the Earth (i.e., MOID) than 0.05 au (roughly 7,480,000km) or are smaller than about 140m in diameter (i.e., H=22.0) are not considered PHAs.
 
The current dataset that we have contains 90,000 rows. Each row represents a NEO identified by an ID and name. Out of these 90,000 rows, 9,000 of them are hazardous and 81,000 of them are non-hazardous. This dataset does not contain null values. Apart from the hazardous target variable, our dataset contains 5 numerical variables that can help identify if the asteroid is hazardous or not. These 5 variables are:

1.	est_diameter_min (km) – estimated minimum diameter of the NEO
1.	est_diameter_max (km) – estimated maximum diameter of the NEO
1.	relative_velocity – the velocity (in km/seconds) with which the NEO was travelling with respect to Earth 
1.	miss_distance – distance (in km) by which the asteroid missed the Earth’s surface
1.	absolute_magnitude (H) – signifies the brightness of the asteroid

Out of these 5 variables, we have 3 variables that play a primary role in determining if the asteroid was harmful or not. Those are:

1.	relative_velocity
1.	miss_distance
1.	absolute_magnitude

Throughout the rest of this RMD file, we go over each of these 3 variables in complete depth to answer our SMART question – what are some of the statistical characteristics of Nearest Earth Objects, over the last 22 years, in terms of relative velocity, miss distance and absolute magnitude, that make them hazardous or not?


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# some of common options (and the defaults) are: 
# include=T, eval=T, echo=T, results='hide'/'asis'/'markup',..., collapse=F, warning=T, message=T, error=T, cache=T, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.dim=c(6,4) #inches, fig.align='left'/'center','right', 
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = F, results = "markup", message = F)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = F, results = "hide", message = F)
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(include = F)
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
options(scientific=T, digits = 3) 
# options(scipen=9, digits = 3) 
# use scipen=999 to prevent scientific notation at all times
```


# Let's explore the dataset
```{r import_data, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
neo <- data.frame(read.csv("neo.csv", header = TRUE))
```
Displaying the structure of the data:
```{r, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
print(str(neo))
```
Displaying the first 6 rows of the dataset:
```{r, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
print(head(neo))
```
The number of NA values in the dataset => `r sum(is.na(neo))`


Now, we split the dataset into 2 dataframes - one for hazardous and other for non-hazardous. This is to ease out the tests performed.

```{r split dataset, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
hazardous = neo %>% filter(hazardous=="True")
non_hazardous = neo %>% filter(hazardous=="False")
```
The dimensions of hazardous asteroids dataframe: `r dim(hazardous)`

The dimensions of non_hazardous asteroids dataframe: `r dim(non_hazardous)`

# Performing measures of central tendency using Summary

Summary of all asteroids is as follows:
```{r summary, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
summary(neo)
```


# Distinct Values
Now, there are multiple asteroids with the same "id" and "name" in the dataset. 
This could happen due to multiple tests being performed on the asteroids or it could be another different reason. We shall remove these in order for the dataset to follow the rules of a relational dataset. 
We use the group_by function provided in R to do so and we take the mean of those asteroids with the same id and name so we don't have any risk of losing the data.
```{r distinct_hazardous_groupby, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
hazardous_grouped = hazardous %>% group_by(name) %>% summarise(absolute_magnitude = mean(absolute_magnitude), relative_velocity = mean(relative_velocity), miss_distance = mean(miss_distance), hazardous = min(hazardous))
```
The dimension of the hazardous dataframe after using only distinct asteroid ID's => `r dim(hazardous_grouped)`



```{r distinct_non_hazardous_groupby, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
non_hazardous_grouped = non_hazardous %>% group_by(name) %>% summarise(absolute_magnitude = mean(absolute_magnitude), relative_velocity = mean(relative_velocity), miss_distance = mean(miss_distance), hazardous = min(hazardous))
```
The dimension of the non_hazardous dataframe after using only distinct asteroid ID's => `r dim(non_hazardous_grouped)`


# Relative Velocity

Relative velocity of an NEO is defined as its velocity compared to the earth. It is measured in kilometers per second. 

```{r, results='markup'}
library(tidyverse)
neo <- read.csv("neo.csv")
hazardous = neo %>% filter(hazardous=="True")
safe = neo %>% filter(hazardous=="False")
xkablesummary(hazardous[c("relative_velocity")])
xkablesummary(safe[c("relative_velocity")])

ttest2sample_neo = t.test(hazardous$relative_velocity,safe$relative_velocity)
ttest2sample_neo

ttestsafe95 = t.test(x=safe$relative_velocity, conf.level = .95)
ttestsafe99 = t.test(x=safe$relative_velocity, conf.level = .99)
ttestsafe95$conf.int
ttestsafe99$conf.int

ttesthaz95 = t.test(x=hazardous$relative_velocity, conf.level = .95)
ttesthaz99 = t.test(x=hazardous$relative_velocity, conf.level = .99)
ttesthaz95$conf.int
ttesthaz99$conf.int

anovavelocity = aov(formula = relative_velocity ~ hazardous, data = neo)
xkabledply(anovavelocity)

tukeyvelocity <- TukeyHSD(anovavelocity)
tukeyvelocity

plot(tukeyvelocity, las=1 , col="brown", title = "TUKEY Multiple Comparison of Means for Relative Velocity")
```

For basic descriptive statistics, measures of central tendency, mean and median, are all higher in the "hazardous" group compared to the objects deemed "safe." 

Using a 2-sample T-Test shows that the difference in means in two groups are significant at the 95% confidence level, as the P-value is smaller than .05.

After constructing confidence intervals at 95% and 99%, we see that the HIGHEST relative velocity in the "safe" condition is lower than the LOWEST relative velocity in the "hazardous" condition, giving more support to the correlation of high relative velocity associated with whether a NEO is hazardous. 

```{r, results='markup'}

qqnorm(hazardous$relative_velocity, col='red', main = 'QQ Plot for Velocity of Hazardous Objects')
qqline(hazardous$relative_velocity)

qqnorm(safe$relative_velocity, col='green', main = 'QQ Plot for Velocity of Safe Objects')
qqline(safe$relative_velocity)

ggplot(data=hazardous, aes(relative_velocity)) + geom_histogram(col='green',fill="red")+labs(x= "Velocity (km/s)", y="Frequency") + labs(title="Frequency Distribution of Hazardous Relative Velocities")

ggplot(data=safe, aes(relative_velocity)) + geom_histogram(col='red',fill="green")+labs(x= "Velocity (km/s)", y="Frequency") + labs(title="Frequency Distribution of Safe Relative Velocities")
```

```{r, results='markup'}
velocity_outlier = outlierKD2(hazardous,relative_velocity, rm=TRUE)
safe_outlier = outlierKD2(safe,relative_velocity, rm=TRUE)
```

Relative velocity is one of the observable characteristics of the Kaggle dataset that other researchers in the field have looked at previously (Araujo 2014). Their research sought to identify the frequency of that asteroids would cross into potentially critical radii (“close encounters”) and, alongside impact parameter, relative velocity was one of the components the researchers examined. The researchers also used histograms to showcase the relative velocity component of their exploratory data analysis. With just a brief glance, the histograms clearly show that asteroids of the Atens groups suffered encounters with a higher relative velocity compared to the Amor group. Their overall findings were similar to ours, with asteroids and their satellites having a higher relative velocity representing the greatest probability of surviving the critical radii in the close encounter. 

To estimate an asteroid’s destructive damage to Earth and her human-built infrastructure, we have baseline comparisons (as horrible as it is) in the area of high-yield nuclear weapons. To approximate asteroid impact energy as comparable to the yield of a high-explosive weapon in the megaton range, we would need to know the asteroid mass. Basic physics kinematics states that kinetic energy is a function of mass and velocity squared, KE= ½ MV^2. A one megaton explosion measures the explosive energy of one million tons of TNT, Trinitrotoluene, and is 4.18x10^15 Joules (Krehl 2008). The atomic bomb that dropped on Hiroshima was only 15 kilotons. Asteroids would yield easily in the megatons (Tonry 2010). Research on the former also requires mass to finalize the estimate of energy, and the scientists have a method to derive mass via density (usually taken as ∼2–3 g cm-3). They use the information to estimate the destructive capacity, as well as proposing early warning detection systems using what they know about asteroid destructive impact. Our work would equally benefit if we had asteroid mass (or a way to derive it).

# Absolute Magnitude 
Absolute magnitude is the third variable that we will be go over in detail. According to Wikipedia, it is defined as a measure of magnitude (brightness) of a celestial object as it would be seen at a standard distance of 10 parsecs. 
Absolute magnitude plays a very important role in determining if the NEO is hazardous or not. This is because the inverse square law states that the brightness of a light source decreases with the square of the size of that asteroid. Hence, this would indicate that absolute magnitude variable must have a certain relationship with the diameter variables of the asteroid (est_diameter_min and est_diameter_max). 
Also, from the official [NASA documentation](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/about/neo_groups.html), it is worth pointing out that the absolute magnitude of the PHAs is always less than 22.0.
Throughout the rest of the documentation, we shall go over plots and perform tests to prove whether the hazardous asteroid's absolute magnitude lies below 22.0 H or no. 

Before that, we shall explore some key characteristics of absolute_magnitude in detail:

Summary of absolute_magintude of hazardous asteroid: 
```{r, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
summary(hazardous$absolute_magnitude)
```

Summary of absolute_magnitude of non-hazardous NEO: 
```{r, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
summary(non_hazardous$absolute_magnitude)
```
 
## Let's find the mode

```{r finding_mode, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}
```
Mode of absolute_magnitude in neo dataset => `r getmode(neo$absolute_magnitude)`

Mode of absolute_magnitude in hazardous dataset => `r getmode(hazardous$absolute_magnitude)`

Mode of absolute_magnitude in non-hazardous dataset => `r getmode(non_hazardous$absolute_magnitude)`


## Measures of Variance and Standard Deviation


Variation of absolute_magnitude of hazardous NEO => `r var(hazardous$absolute_magnitude)`

Variation of absolute_magnitude of non_hazardous NEO => `r var(non_hazardous$absolute_magnitude)`



Standard deviation of absolute_magnitude of hazardous NEO => `r sd(hazardous$absolute_magnitude)`

Standard deviation of absolute_magnitude of non_hazardous NEO => `r sd(non_hazardous$absolute_magnitude)`

## Graphical understanding using Plots

```{r graphical_representation, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(hazardous, aes(x=absolute_magnitude)) + geom_histogram(bins=70, color="black", fill="red") + labs(x="Absolute Magnitude", y="Frequency Count", title = "Histogram of absolute_magnitude of hazardous asteroids")

ggplot(non_hazardous, aes(x=absolute_magnitude)) + geom_histogram(bins=70, color="black", fill="green") + labs(x="Absolute Magnitude", y="Frequency Count", title = "Histogram of absolute_magnitude of non_hazardous asteroids")

ggplot(neo, aes(x=absolute_magnitude, y=hazardous)) + geom_point(col = "lightblue") + labs(x="Absolute Magnitude", y="Hazardous", title = "Scatter plot for hazardous vs non-hazardous asteroids")

qqnorm(hazardous$absolute_magnitude, main="QQ Plot of the absolute magnitude of hazardous asteroids")

qqnorm(non_hazardous$absolute_magnitude, main="QQ Plot of the absolute magnitude of non-hazardous asteroids")
```

Note - We see that the absolute_magnitude for hazardous NEO lies mostly between 19 to 22. While that of the non-hazardous asteroids gnerally lies between 23 to 27. 

This proves what was mentioned in NASA documentation that Potentially Hazardous Asteroids have an absolute magnitude of 22.0 H or less.

## Outliers
Knowing if the dataset has outliers is a good way to know if the dataset has any "bad data". And it is essential to know or keep track of the number of records that represent outliers. To keep track of the outliers in the dataset, we shall use outlierKD2 function:
```{r hazardous_outlier_removal, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
hazardous_outlier_removed = outlierKD2(hazardous,absolute_magnitude, qqplt=TRUE, rm=TRUE)
```
The dimension of the hazardous dataframe after removing outliers: `r dim(hazardous_outlier_removed)`


```{r outlier_non_hazardous_removal, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
non_hazardous_outlier_removed = outlierKD2(non_hazardous,absolute_magnitude, qqplt=TRUE, rm=TRUE)
```

The dimension of the non_hazardous dataframe after removing outliers: `r dim(non_hazardous_outlier_removed)`

## T-Tests
Now, with all outliers removed and distinct values extracted, we can perform t-tests.

T-Tests on hazardous dataframe:
```{r t-test-hazardous, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
t.test(hazardous_grouped$absolute_magnitude)
```

T-Tests on non_hazardous dataframe:
```{r t-test-non-hazardous, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
t.test(non_hazardous_grouped$absolute_magnitude)
```

## Contingency Table
Now, we shall validate the above by printing the Contingency table.
The contingency table of hazardous is below:
```{r frequency_cut_hazardous, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
table(cut(hazardous_grouped$absolute_magnitude,seq(16,23,0.5)))
```

We see a higher frequency of values falling in the interval 21-22 for hazardous asteroids. However, as noticed in the plots drawn, the plot is left skewed. Hence, the average/mean shifted a bit towards the left. 

Here too, we can confirm that the PHAs in our dataset follow the official NASA documentation.

The contingency table of non_hazardous is below:
```{r frequency_cut_non_hazardous, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
table(cut(non_hazardous_grouped$absolute_magnitude,seq(16,32,0.5)))
```

We see a higher frequency of values falling in the interval 24-25 for non_hazardous.

## Anova Test:
For anova test, we need 2 samples of equal size - one from hazardous and another from non-hazardous
```{r aov_test, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
# creating a third column in both dataframes to account for categorical variable - hazardous
non_hazardous_grouped$hazardous=0
hazardous_grouped$hazardous=1
non_hazardous_sample = sample(1:nrow(non_hazardous_grouped), size=2105)
summary(aov(absolute_magnitude ~ hazardous, data=rbind(hazardous_grouped, non_hazardous_sample)))
```

Observation - the p-value is a small number (<0.001) which indicates that we can reject the null hypothesis and confirm that the mean for hazardous and non-hazardous NEOs is not the same. 
Note that the p-value is same from results obtained in anova test and t-test.

Here, we finally prove that our dataset has the correct definition of PHAs and that they all have an absolute magnitude less than 22 H. 


## Correlation with Diameter
A correlation plot is used to determine how close each variable is to the other. We know from earlier that the absolute magnitude is inversely related to the size of the NEO. We shall draw a correlation plot with est_diameter_min and est_diameter_max to verify and see if it does hold significance or not?
```{r correlation_magnitude_diameter, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
library(corrplot)
corrplot(cor(hazardous %>% select(absolute_magnitude, est_diameter_min, est_diameter_max), method = "pearson"), method="number", title="Pearson correlation of absolute magnitude with diameter variables", mar=c(1,1,1,1))
```

As noted in the above correlation plot, we see that the the min and max estimated diameter is closely related to the absolute magnitude. It is inversely related. This makes sense because absolute magnitude (brightness of a NEO) indicates the size of the asteroid in question. And hence, we can say that the bigger the size of the asteroid, lesser the absolute magnitude (brighter the star), and thus potentially more hazardous is the asteroid.



# Overall Correlation Plots:
After exploring each of these 3 variables, we shall now see their correlation with that of our target variable - hazardous. We shall draw both - Pearson and Spearman correlation plots. 

```{r, results='markup', echo=FALSE}
hazardous$hazardous = as.integer(as.logical(hazardous$hazardous))
non_hazardous$hazardous = as.integer(as.logical(non_hazardous$hazardous))

corrplot(cor(rbind(hazardous, non_hazardous) %>% select(absolute_magnitude, miss_distance, relative_velocity, est_diameter_min, est_diameter_max, hazardous ), method= "pearson"), method="number", title = "Pearson Correlation", outline = TRUE, mar = c(1,1,1,1))

corrplot(cor(rbind(hazardous, non_hazardous) %>% select(absolute_magnitude, miss_distance, relative_velocity, est_diameter_min, est_diameter_max, hazardous ), method= "spearman"), method="number", title = "Spearman Correlation", outline = TRUE, mar = c(1,1,1,1))
```

Here, we see that hazardous variable has a higher correlation with absolute magnitude, and the diameter variables. This means that the size and brightness of the asteroid plays a very significant role in deciding if the asteroid is hazardous or not. These variables are followed by relative velocity and miss distance.

# Limitations

The `neo.csv` data set posed limitations in the variables, description and dictionary. Since the dataset was obtained from a web-based environment, kaggle, we had insufficient variables, a poor description of the dataset and no data dictionary provided. In terms of the variables provided, it would have been ideal to have one regarding the trajectory towards, or away, from earth, as well as other potentially hazardous, or not hazardous, variables. Nevertheless, we were restricted to just using the three variables that were quantifiable in order to characterize the potential of it being hazardous. In retrospect, just using these three variables might have been an over-simplification in our determination of a hazard. On the other hand, the description of the dataset is very limited given the constraint of using Kaggle. It would have been better if the dataset was obtained straight from a NASA website or API, however this was not possible. It would have been a huge perk to know how these variables are being used by NASA professionals, what characterizes an instance to be recorded multiple times, and why they initially attributed the boolean value for Hazardous. Finally, when it came to providing a data dictionary, the kaggle website did not have one. Thus, we had to do our own research as to what these variables meant, and what they were describing. Therefore, with insufficient variables, a poor description and no data dictionary it was difficult to infer, or fully understand, the root of a hazardous or not hazardous asteroid to fully answer our question.
