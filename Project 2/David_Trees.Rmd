# Introduction
<span style="color: Blue;"> Our research topic aims to perform explorartory data analysis on the Nearest Earth Objects (NEO) dataset recorded by NASA. This particular dataset includes thousands of labeled observations, over the last 22 years, across multiple attributes that each aim to describe a specific object. Borrowing from the humor of the recent film *Don’t Look Up* by Adam Mckay and NASA’s success in the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, we thought that further describing and exploring this dataset would be opportune.</span> 

<span style="color: Green;">The EDA performed can help with the early detection of an asteroid. With the early detection, NASA can take quick remedies to help eliminate the threat. NASA’s *DART* mission (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) was done for the same purpose. It was designed to deflect an asteroid with a certain momentum by hitting it head-on or attempting to slow it down. More can be read online from this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Asteroid_Redirection_Test).</span> 

<span style="color: Purple;">According to NASA’s [official documentation](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/about/neo_groups.html), a PHA is technically termed using parameters that measure the asteroid’s characteristics and then make a decision if the asteroid is considered hazardous based on certain thresholds. Specifically, all asteroids with an Earth Minimum Orbit intersection Distance (MOID) of 0.05 au or less and an absolute magnitude (H) of 22.0 or less are considered Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). In other words, asteroids that can’t get any closer to the Earth (i.e., MOID) than 0.05 au (roughly 7,480,000km) or are smaller than about 140m in diameter (i.e., H=22.0) are not considered PHAs.</span> 
 
<span style="color: Cyan;">The current dataset that we have contains 90,000 rows. Each row represents a NEO identified by an ID and name. Out of these 90,000 rows, 9,000 of them are hazardous and 81,000 of them are non-hazardous. This dataset does not contain null values. Apart from the hazardous target variable, our dataset contains 5 numerical variables that can help identify if the asteroid is hazardous or not. These 5 variables are:</span> 

1.	est_diameter_min (km) – estimated minimum diameter of the NEO
1.	est_diameter_max (km) – estimated maximum diameter of the NEO
1.	relative_velocity – the velocity (in km/seconds) with which the NEO was travelling with respect to Earth 
1.	miss_distance – distance (in km) by which the asteroid missed the Earth’s surface
1.	absolute_magnitude (H) – signifies the brightness of the asteroid

Out of these 5 variables, we have 3 variables that play a primary role in determining if the asteroid was harmful or not. Those are:

1.	relative_velocity
1.	miss_distance
1.	absolute_magnitude

Throughout the rest of this RMD file, we go over each of these 3 variables in complete depth to answer our SMART question – what are some of the statistical characteristics of Nearest Earth Objects, over the last 22 years, in terms of relative velocity, miss distance and absolute magnitude, that make them hazardous or not?

Decision Trees are a type of nonparametric supervised machine learning algo that work to form categorical and/or quantitative predictors. In many ways, they do exactly what they sound like: allow the reader to decide on the probability of certain outcomes based on concurrent and previous criteria.

The following code begins by plotting a simple classification tree and showing the size of the relative "x" error. 

```{r}
install.packages("rpart", repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org') # Classification trees, rpart(formula, data=, method=,control=)
library(rpart)
```

```{r, echo = T, fig.dim=c(8,8)}
set.seed(1)
neo <- read.csv("neo.csv")
neofit <- rpart(hazardous ~  absolute_magnitude + miss_distance + relative_velocity, data=neo, method="class", control = list(maxdepth = 4) )
printcp(neofit) # display the results 
plotcp(neofit) # visualize cross-validation results 
summary(neofit) # detailed summary of splits

# plot tree 
plot(neofit, uniform=TRUE, main="Classification Tree for NEO")
text(neofit, use.n=TRUE, all=TRUE, cex=0.9, col="red")
```

```{r}

```{r, include=T}

xkabledply(cm$table, "confusion matrix")
print('Overall: ')
cm$overall
print('Class: ')
cm$byClass
```

```{r}
confusionMatrixResultDf = data.frame( Depth=numeric(0), Accuracy= numeric(0), Sensitivity=numeric(0), Specificity=numeric(0), Pos.Pred.Value=numeric(0), Neg.Pred.Value=numeric(0), Precision=numeric(0), Recall=numeric(0), F1=numeric(0), Prevalence=numeric(0), Detection.Rate=numeric(0), Detection.Prevalence=numeric(0), Balanced.Accuracy=numeric(0), row.names = NULL )

for (deep in 2:6) {
neofit2 <- rpart(hazardous ~  absolute_magnitude + miss_distance + relative_velocity, data=neo, method="class", control = list(maxdepth = deep) )
cm2 = confusionMatrix( predict(neofit2, type = "class"), reference = neo[, "hazardous"] )
 cmaccu = cm2$overall['Accuracy']
 cmt = data.frame(Depth=deep, Accuracy = cmaccu, row.names = NULL )
